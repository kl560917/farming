Tabby does a lot of the marketing, salad packing, and deliveries to wholesale accounts (such as restaurants). She essentially handles the business side, and she also homeschools their kids. On Wednesdays, she does deliveries of lettuce and spinach to restaurants like Little Fish Brewery, Farmacy, Village Bakery, and Kindred Market before doing the weekly errands in town. Then she picks up Eliza from track practice.

The kids have pigs and chickens that are separate from the commercial farm operation. They are supposed to take care of these creatures, and they have animal-related chores. Sometimes Adam has to catch up on these chores, but he says they are learning responsibility from the process of taking care of these animals. In the winter months, they do less work out on the farm. However, when the weather allows, they help out with collection and assist their dad in the greenhouses. The younger two kids are more enthusiastic in their assistance. “Farming is a family adventure,” said Tabby.

                                In addition to outdoor rows of crops, The Blaney's use their three greenhouses to grow crops more efficiently. “We have one large high tunnel which is protected growing space, which just means it looks like a greenhouse structure, but it doesn't have a floor,” said Adam. “All of our crops that were growing are still in the ground”. The climate-controlled environment of the high tunnel provides season extension, allowing for crops to be planted earlier in the Spring and through the winter. The high tunnel was funded by a grant from the USDA’s National Resource Conservation Service.

He says this is a common problem of living in this area. The added cost of driving is especially enhanced by the prices of gas. Many people, especially low-income families, cannot always afford to travel often for fresh food.

                                Adam and Tabby hope to foster connections between people and locally grown, healthy food. Part of their business is selling vegetables to wholesale accounts, but they prefer selling to their CSA accounts. According to the USDA, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) is a production and marketing model where “consumers buy shares of a farm's harvest in advance”. Beginning in May, people who sign up as CSA customers receive boxes of produce from the Blaney Family Farm. Instead of just getting a delivery of vegetables, CSA customers come to the farm to get their box and have the ability to volunteer on the farm for a day. The CSA program allows the Blaneys to make their customer’s relationship to their food more personal.

                                They are also in the process of getting the permits to build a community space with a pizza oven on their property. They want to host events where people can come and check out the farm. It is important to them for people to see and feel involved with where their food comes from and how it is produced.

                                Off the road and up the Blaney driveway, the Farm Stand sits between the sizable, wooden storage barn and gravel path leading up to the white-painted house with burgundy shutters on its windows. The Farm Stand shelters a double-door industrial fridge, a couple coolers, a chalkboard menu, and a cup for payments. In the fridge are a variety of goods produced by the Blaneys, all for reasonable prices. The Farm Stand runs on an honor system. However, its main purpose is the same as the farm’s itself: to expand access to fresh food to their neighbors. They have dreams of expanding their farm stand into a permanent location in town. Tabby said she would love to start a grocery store that doubles as a community hub.
